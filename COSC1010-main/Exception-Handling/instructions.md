# Instructions  

Modify the program that you wrote for `Average of Numbers` so it handles the following exceptions:

- It should handle any `IOError` exceptions that are raised when the file is opened and data is read from it.

- It should handle any `ValueError` exceptions that are raised when the items that are read from the file are converted to a number. 


What I learned:

We can put multiple try and except statements all around the program

the "except...:" has to be an error code, as when we try a section a code and an exception (error) occurs,
we execute an alternate piece of code instead. Similar to an if statement but not quite.








REMEMBER: An IO exception is an exception that occurs when the file isn't opened correctly.
